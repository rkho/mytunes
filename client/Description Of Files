// COLLECTIONS //
Collections are groups of Song Models.

SongQueue
  * A queue of songs we are holding for future playback. Songs in the queue will play in a first-in, first-out manner.
  * If a song is added to a queue, one of the following happens:
    + If it is the ONLY song in the queue, it will automatically play.
    + If there are MORE songs in the queue, nothing will happen.
  * If a song in the queue finishes playing, one of the following will happen:
    + The next song in the queue is played.
    + If there are no further songs in the queue, the music comes to an end.

Songs
  * A collection of song names.

// MODELS //
Models are containers of 'truth' data.

AppModel
  * Contains the means to play a song as well as enqueue one.
  * When a song is played, it is set to the "currentSong", which is then displayed in the AppView.
  * All songs get enqueued at one point.

SongModel
  * Contains data for song name/artist/URL/etc.
  * Also contains triggers for when songs are clicked/played/enqueued/dequeued, etc.
    + The triggers don't explicitly do anything, they refer to other events that Views are listening for.
